#Preliminary Project Proposal


##Title
FeupFall

##What is
Will you be able to get out of FEUP?

##Goal
Try to overcome your many difficulties at FEUP, in order to become a full-fledged engineer. Your ultimate objective is to exit FEUP with the best score possible (but of course, you can’t, this is an endless game).

##Design
Player act as student, trying to get out of FEUP, while trying to defeat the incoming waves of enemies with the help of his weapon.

##Player type (student)
The player is free falling in the pit and can also jump from platform to platform. He uses his weapon to destroy the enemies or even the platforms, which might open a way for him to pass through. The platforms allows the player to charge his weapon.

##Power ups
* ***The Pen Of Multiple Choices*** - You can't fail a multiple choice exam with this pen! (would destroy all enemies currently on the screen)
* ***Bibliography Book*** - Yes, that book which you never read. Sometimes is useful. (would heal one life)
* ***Golden Draft Paper*** - The miraculous draft paper with all the correct answers to your exam! (would turn the player projectile into a laser, destroying everything that touches it)
* ***The Dark Pencil of Destruction*** - This pencil never runs out (would provide some seconds for the player to shoot, without wasting bullets)
* ***FEUP Caffé Beer*** - Just one more… (this is a downgrade. Would slow down the player).
* ***SINF*** - Pure evil. (this is a downgrade. Would turn all enemies temporarily invincible).

##Enemies
* ***Books***: “Normal” enemies which the player can shoot
* ***Exams***: Enemies that move towards the player, they are coming to you
* ***Calendars***: Deadlines are coming. The days fly past you, hurting you, one bit at a time. Shoots projectiles at the player, but deal little damage.

* Bosses
  * ***Prof. Augusto Sousa*** - Beware his mighty projectile: The Blazing ‘Stache of Death!
  * ***Prof. Raul Vidal*** - This boss shoots very quickly. I hope you can dodge.
